## Loading content

Beetle PSX HW needs a cue-sheet that points to an image file. A cue sheet, or cue file, is a metadata file which describes how the tracks of a CD or DVD are laid out.

If you have e.g. `foo.bin`, you should create a text file and save it as `foo.cue`. Most PS1 games are single-track, so the cue file contents should look like this:

`foobin.cue`
```
 FILE "foo.bin" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
   INDEX 01 00:00:00
```

After that, you can load the `foo.cue` file in RetroArch with the Beetle PSX HW core.

!!! attention
    Certain PS1 games are multi-track, so their .cue files might be more complicated.

### Playing PAL copy protected games

PAL copy protected games need a SBI Subchannel file next to the bin/cue files in order to get past the copy protection.

- Ape Escape (Europe).bin
- Ape Escape (Europe).cue
- **Ape Escape (Europe).sbi**

!!! warning
	For proper PAL game compatibility, the 'Skip BIOS' core option needs to be set to off.

### Multiple-disk games

If foo is a multiple-disk game, you should have .cue files for each one, e.g. `foo (Disc 1).cue`, `foo (Disc 2).cue`, `foo (Disc 3).cue`.

To take advantage of Beetle PSW HW's Disk Control feature for disk swapping, an index file (a m3u file) should be made.

Create a text file and save it as `foo.m3u`. Then enter your game's .cue files on it. The m3u file contents should look something like this:

`foo.m3u`
```
foo (Disc 1).cue
foo (Disc 2).cue
foo (Disc 3).cue
```

After that, you can load the `foo.m3u` file in RetroArch with the Beetle PSX HW core.

Here's a m3u example done with Valkryie Profile

![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/m3u.png)

!!! attention
	Adding multi-track games to a RetroArch playlist is recommended. (Manually add an entry a playlist that points to `foo.m3u`)

#### Swapping disks

Swapping disks follows this procedure

1. Open tray (Disk Cycle Tray Status)

2. Change the Disk Index to the disk you want to swap to.

3. Close tray (Disk Cycle Tray Status)

4. Return to the game and wait a few seconds to let it take effect

### Compressed content

Alternatively to using cue sheets with .bin/.iso files, you can convert your games to .pbp (Playstation Portable update file) or .chd (MAME Compressed Hunks of Data) to reduce file sizes and neaten up your game folder.

#### PBP

A recommended .pbp convert tool is PSX2PSP.

If converting a multiple-disk game, all disks should be added to the same .pbp file, rather than making a .m3u file for them.

Most conversion tools will want a single .bin file for each disk. If your game uses multiple .bin files (tracks) per disk, you will have to mount the cue sheet to a virtual drive and re-burn the images onto a single track before conversion.

For multi-disk PAL copy-protected games, change the sbi file syntax from `[filename].sbi` to `[filename]_[disc_number].sbi`

- Final Fantasy IX (Germany).pbp
- **Final Fantasy IX (Germany)_1.sbi**
- **Final Fantasy IX (Germany)_2.sbi**
- **Final Fantasy IX (Germany)_3.sbi**
- **Final Fantasy IX (Germany)_4.sbi**

!!! attention
    RetroArch does not currently have .pbp database due to variability in users' conversion methods. All .pbp games will have to be added to playlists manually.

#### CHD

To convert content to CHD format, use the chdman tool found inside the latest MAME distribution and point it to a .cue file, like so:

```
chdman createcd --input foo.cue --output foo.chd
```

Note that the tool currrently does not integrate .sbi files into the .chd, so these must be placed alongside the resulting .chd file in order to properly play games with LibCrypt protection.

!!! attention
	For multi-disc content, make an .m3u file that lists all the .chd files instead of .cue files. Like the PBP files, content must be added to playlists manually.

## Saves

For game savedata storage, the PSX console used memory cards. The PSX console had two slots for memory cards.

In this doc, the first memory card slot will be referred to as 'Memcard slot 0' and the second slot will be referred to as 'Memcard slot 1'.

For memory card functionality and usage, the Beetle PSX HW core will either use the Libretro savedata format or the Mednafen savedata format.

<center>

| Libretro savedata format   |  Mednafen savedata format        |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| gamename.srm               |   gamename.slot#.mcr             |

</center>

**By default**, the Beetle PSX HW core will use Libretro's savedata format for Memcard slot 0 and Mednafen's savedata format for Memcard slot 1.

<center>

| Memcard slot 0 | Memcard slot 1 |
|----------------|----------------|
| gamename.srm   | gamename.1.mcr |

</center>

!!! attention
    Memory card behavior can be controlled with the following [core options](https://docs.libretro.com/library/beetle_psx/#core-options) (Memcard 0 method, Enable memory card 1, Shared memcards).

**By default**, the filenames of the Memcard savedata will match the loaded cue or m3u or pbp filename, like this:

- Loaded content: Breath of Fire III (USA).cue

- **Memcard slot 0: Breath of Fire III (USA).srm**

- **Memcard slot 1: Breath of Fire III (USA).1.mcr**

or

- Loaded content: Final Fantasy VII (USA).m3u

- **Memcard slot 0: Final Fantasy VII (USA).srm**

- **Memcard slot 1: Final Fantasy VII (USA).1.mcr**

or

- Loaded content: Wild Arms 2 (USA).pbp

- **Memcard slot 0: `Wild Arms 2 (USA).srm**

- **Memcard slot 1: `Wild Arms 2 (USA).1.mcr**

!!! attention
	To import your old memory cards from other emulators, you need to rename them to either the Libretro savedata format or the Mednafen savedata format.

!!! warning
	Keep in mind that save states also include the state of the memory card; carelessly loading an old save state will **OVEWRITE** the memory card, potentially resulting in lost saved games. **You can set the 'Don't overwrite SaveRAM on loading savestate' option in RetroArch's Saving settings to On to prevent this.**

## Core options

The Beetle PSX HW core has the following option(s) that can be tweaked from the core options menu. The default setting is bolded.

Settings with (Restart) means that core has to be closed for the new setting to be applied on next launch.

- **Renderer (restart)** [beetle_psx_hw_renderer] (hardware/software)

	Choose which video renderer will be used.

	Software is the most accurate renderer. However, it is also the most demanding renderer at higher resolutions than native. So in case you want to increase the internal resolution and you have a capable GPU, it's highly recommended you use the 'hardware' option instead.

	The OpenGL and Vulkan renderers are less accurate at the moment but will enable and/or speedup enhancements like upscaling and texture filtering.

	By setting this to 'hardware',  depending on which video driver has been selected in RetroArch, it will automatically switch to either the OpenGL renderer or the Vulkan renderer.

	Also important to keep in mind is shader support. The Vulkan renderer supports Slang shaders, while the OpenGL renderer supports GLSL shaders.

- **Software framebuffer** [beetle_psx_hw_renderer_software_fb] (Off/**On**)

	If off, the software renderer will skip some steps.

	Potential speedup.

	Causes bad graphics when doing framebuffer readbacks.

- **Adaptive smoothing** [beetle_psx_hw_adaptive_smoothing] (Off/**On**)

	When upscaling, smooths out 2D elements while keeping 3D elements sharp.

	**Only for the Vulkan renderer at the moment.**

??? note "*Adaptive smoothing - Off*"
    ![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/smooth_off.png)

??? note "*Adaptive smoothing - On*"
    ![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/smooth_on.png)

- **Internal GPU resolution** [beetle_psx_hw_internal_resolution] (**1x(native)**/2x/4x/8x/16x/32x)

	Modify the resolution.

??? note "*Internal GPU Resolution - 1x*"
    ![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/gpu_1.png)

??? note "*Internal GPU Resolution - 2x*"
    ![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/gpu_2.png)

- **Texture filtering** [beetle_psx_hw_filter] (**nearest**/SABR/xBR/bilinear/3-point/JINC2)

	Per-texture filtering.

	**Only for the OpenGL renderer at the moment.**

??? note "*nearest*"
    ![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/nearest.png)

??? note "*SABR*"
    ![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/sabr.png)

??? note "*xBR*"
    ![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/xbr.png)

??? note "*bilinear*"
    ![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/bilinear.png)

??? note "*3-point*"
    ![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/3point.png)

??? note "*JINC2*"
    ![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/jinc2.png)

- **Internal color depth** [beetle_psx_hw_internal_color_depth] (**dithered 16bpp (native)**/32bpp)

	PSX had 16bpp depth, Beetle PSX HW can go up to 32bpp.

	**Only for the OpenGL and Vulkan renderers at the moment.**

	**The Vulkan renderer always uses 32bpp.**

- **Wireframe mode** [beetle_psx_hw_wireframe] (**Off**/On)

	Shows only the outlines of polygons. Only for the OpenGL renderer.

	**For debug use.**

??? note "Wireframe mode - On"
	![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/wire.png)

- **Display full VRAM** [beetle_psx_hw_display_vram] (**Off**/On)

	Everything in VRAM is drawn on screen.

	**For debug use.**

??? note "Display full VRAM - On"
	![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/vram.png)

- **PGXP operation mode** [beetle_psx_hw_pgxp_mode] (**Off**/memory only/memory + CPU)

	When on, floating point coordinates will be used for vertex positions, to avoid the PSX polygon jitter. 'memory + cpu' mode can further reduce jitter at the cost of performance and geometry glitches.

	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYCpd_1lPUc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYCpd_1lPUc)

- **PGXP vertex cache** [beetle_psx_hw_pgxp_caching] (**Off**/On)

	Maintains a cache for vertices. May result in better performance but can result in graphics glitches in most games.

- **PGXP perspective correct texturing** [beetle_psx_hw_pgxp_texture] (**Off**/On)

	Original PSX did affine texture mapping, resulting in e.g. crooked lines across walls. This fixes it.

- **Widescreen mode hack** [beetle_psx_hw_widescreen_hack] (**Off**/On)

	If on, renders in 16:9. Works best on 3D games.

??? note "Widescreen mode hack - Off"
	![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/wide_off.png)

??? note "Widescreen mode hack - On"
	![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/wide_on.png)

- **Frame duping (speedup)** [beetle_psx_hw_frame_duping_enable] (**Off**/On)

	Redraws/reuses the last frame if there was no new data.

- **CPU frequency scaling (overclock)** [beetle_psx_hw_cpu_freq_scale] (50% to 500% in increments of 10%. **100% is default**)

	Overclock the emulated PSX's CPU.

- **GTE Overclock** [beetle_psx_hw_gte_overclock] (**Off**/On)

	Gets rid of memory access latency and makes all GTE instructions have 1 cycle latency.

- **GPU rasterizer overclock** [beetle_psx_hw_gpu_overclock] (**1x(native)**/2x/4x/8x/16x/32x)

	Overclock the emulated PSX's GPU rasterizer.

- **Skip BIOS** [beetle_psx_hw_skipbios] (**Off**/On)

	Self-explanatory.

	**Some games have issues when this core option is enabled (Saga Frontier, PAL copy protected games, etc).**

??? note "Skip BIOS - Off"
	![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/bios.png)

- **Dithering pattern** [beetle_psx_hw_dither_mode] (**1x(native)**/internal resolution/Off)

	If off, disables the dithering pattern the PSX applies to combat color banding.

	**Only for the OpenGL and Software renderers.**

	**Vulkan always disables the pattern.**

- **Display internal FPS** [beetle_psx_hw_display_internal_framerate] (**Off**/On)

	Shows the frame rate at which the emulated PSX is drawing at.

	**Onscreen Notifications must be enabled in the RetroArch Onscreen Display Settings.**

??? note "Display internal FPS - On"
	![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/fps.png)

	Sets the first scanline to be drawn on screen.

- **Last scanline** [beetle_psx_hw_last_scanline] (210 to 239 in increments of 1. **239 is default**)

	Sets the last scanline to be drawn on screen.

- **Initial scanline PAL** [beetle_psx_hw_initial_scanline_pal] (0 to 40 in increments of 1. **0 is default**)

	Sets the first scanline to be drawn on screen for PAL systems.

- **Last scanline PAL** [beetle_psx_hw_last_scanline_pal] (260 to 287 in increments of 1. **287 is default**)

	Sets the last scanline to be drawn on screen for PAL systems.

- **Crop Overscan** [beetle_psx_hw_crop_overscan] (**Setting1**/Setting2)

	Crop out the potentially random glitchy video output that would have been hidden by the bezel around the edge of a standard-definition television screen.

??? note "Crop Overscan - On"
	![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/scan_on.png)

??? note "Crop Overscan - Off"
	![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/scan_off.png)

- **Additional Cropping** [beetle_psx_hw_image_crop] (**Off**/1 px/2 px/3 px/4 px/5 px/6 px/7 px/8 px)

	Self-explanatory.

- **Offset Cropped Image** [beetle_psx_hw_image_offset] (**Off**/1 px/2 px/3 px/4 px/-4 px/-3 px/-2 px/-1 px)

	Self-explanatory.

- **Analog self-calibration** [beetle_psx_hw_analog_calibration] (**Off**/On)

	When enabled, monitors the max values reached by the input, using it as a calibration heuristic which then scales the analog coordinates sent to the emulator accordingly. For best results, rotate the sticks at max amplitude for the algorithm to get a good estimate of the scaling factor, otherwise it will adjust while playing.

- **DualShock Analog button toggle** [beetle_psx_hw_analog_toggle] (**Setting1**/Setting2)

	Toggles the Analog button from DualShock controllers, if disabled analogs are always on, if enabled you can toggle their state by pressing and holding START+SELECT+L1+L2+R1+R2.

- **Port 1: Multitap enable** [beetle_psx_hw_enable_multitap_port2] (**Off**/On)

- **Gun Cursor** [beetle_psx_hw_gun_cursor] (**Cross**/Dot/Off)

	Choose the cursor for the 'Guncon / G-Con 45' and 'Justifier' Device Types. Setting it to off disables the crosshair.

??? note "Gun Cursor - Cross"
	![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/cursor_cross.png)

??? note "Gun Cursor - Dot"
	![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/cursor_dot.png)

??? note "Gun Cursor - Off"
	![](/image/core/beetle_psx_hw/cursor_off.png)		

- **Mouse Sensitivity** [beetle_psx_hw_mouse_sensitivity] (5% to 200% in increments of 5%. **100% is default**)

	Configure the 'Mouse' Device Type's sensitivity.

- **NegCon Twist Deadzone (percent)** [beetle_psx_hw_negcon_deadzone] (**0**|5|10|15|20|25|30)

	Sets the deadzone of the RetroPad left analog stick when simulating the 'twist' action of emulated [neGcon Controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeGcon). Used to eliminate drift/unwanted input.

!!! attention
	Most (all?) negCon compatible titles provide in-game options for setting a 'twist' deadzone value. To avoid loss of precision, the in-game deadzone should *always* be set to zero. Any analog stick drift should instead be accounted for by configuring the 'NegCon Twist Deadzone' core option. This is particularly important when 'NegCon Twist Response' is set to 'quadratic' or 'cubic'.

	Xbox gamepads typically require a deadzone of 15-20%. Many Android-compatible bluetooth gamepads have an internal 'hardware' deadzone, allowing the deadzone value here to be set to 0%.

	For convenience, it is recommended to make use of the 'Options → Analog Setting 1P' menu of [Gran Turismo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Turismo_(video_game)) when calibrating the 'NegCon Twist Deadzone'. This provides a clear and precise representation of 'real' controller input values.

- **NegCon Twist Response** [beetle_psx_hw_negcon_response] (**linear**|quadratic|cubic)

	Specifies the analog response when using a RetroPad left analog stick to simulate the 'twist' action of emulated [neGcon Controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeGcon).

	'linear': Analog stick displacement is mapped linearly to negCon rotation angle.

	'quadratic': Analog stick displacement is mapped quadratically to negCon rotation angle. This allows for greater precision when making small movements with the analog stick.

	'cubic': Analog stick displacement is mapped cubically to negCon rotation angle. This allows for even greater precision when making small movements with the analog stick, but 'exaggerates' larger movements.

!!! attention
	A linear response is not recommended when using standard gamepad devices. The negCon 'twist' mechanism is substantially different from conventional analog sticks; linear mapping over-amplifies small displacements of the stick, impairing fine control. A linear response is only appropriate when using racing wheel peripherals.

	In most cases, the 'quadratic' option should be selected. This provides effective compensation for the physical differences between real/emulated hardware, enabling smooth/precise analog input.

- **CD Access Method (restart)** [beetle_psx_hw_cd_access_method] (**sync**/async/precache)

	The precache setting loads the complete image in memory at startup. Can potentially decrease loading times at the cost of increased startup time.

- **Memcard 0 method** [beetle_psx_hw_use_mednafen_memcard0_method] (**libretro**/mednafen)

	Choose the savedata format used for Memcard 0 (libretro or mednafen). Look above at the [Saves section](https://docs.libretro.com/library/beetle_psx_hw/#saves) for an explanation regarding the libretro and mednafen formats.

- **Enable memory card 1** [beetle_psx_hw_enable_memcard1] (Off/**On**)

	Enable or disables Memcard slot 1. When disabled, games cannot save/load to Memcard slot 1.  

	**Memcard 1 must be enabled for game 'Codename Tenka'.**

- **Shared memcards (restart)** [beetle_psx_hw_shared_memory_cards] (**Off**/On)

	Games will share and save/load to the same memory cards.

	**The 'Memcard 0 method' core option needs to be set to 'mednafen' for the 'Shared memcards' core option to function properly.**

- **Increase CD loading speed** [beetle_psx_hw_cd_fastload] (**2x (native)**/4x/6x/8x/10x/12x/14x)

	Can greatly reduce the loading times in games.

	**May not work correctly in all games. Some games may break if you set them past a certain speed.**
