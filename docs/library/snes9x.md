## Geometry and timing

- The Snes9x core's core provided FPS is 60.0988118623 for NTSC games and 50.0069789082 for PAL games.
- The Snes9x core's core provided sample rate is 32040 Hz

- The Snes9x core's base height is 224 when the Crop Overscan core option is set to enabled. 239 when it's set to disabled.
- The Snes9x core's max width is 512
- The Snes9x core's max height is 478
- The Snes9x core's core provided aspect ratio is dependent on the ['Preferred aspect ratio' core option](https://docs.libretro.com/library/snes9x#core-options).

## MSU-1 support

MSU-1 support in the Snes9x core follows the SD2SNES/Snes9x naming format, i.e.

```
gamename.sfc
gamename.msu
gamename-#.pcm
```

Loading a manifest.bml file or having a xml file isn't necessary. **Just load gamename.sfc.**

Here's an example of a working MSU-1 setup done with [Secret of Mana MSU-1](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2467/). Please note that som_msu1.sfc is being [softpatched](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/softpatching/) in this example.

## Core options

The Snes9x core has the following option(s) that can be tweaked from the core options menu. The default setting is bolded. 

Settings with (Restart) means that core has to be closed for the new setting to be applied on next launch.

- **Allow Opposing Directions** [snes9x_up_down_allowed] (**disabled**|enabled)

	Enabling this will allow pressing / quickly alternating / holding both left and right (or up and down in some games) directions at the same time. 
	
	This may cause movement based glitches to occur in certain games.
	
	It's best to keep this core option disabled.
