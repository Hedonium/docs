## Loading Sega Saturn content

!!! warning
    Yabause does not support cue files that point to multiple bin files. Convert multi-bin tracks to single-bin tracks for proper operation.

Yabause needs a cue-sheet that points to an image file. A cue sheet, or cue file, is a metadata file which describes how the tracks of a CD or DVD are laid out.

If you have e.g. `foo.bin`, you should create a text file and save it as `foo.cue`. If you're playing a single-track Saturn game, then the cue file contents should look like this:

`foobin.cue`
```
 FILE "foo.bin" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
   INDEX 01 00:00:00
```

After that, you can load the `foo.cue` file in RetroArch with the Yabause core.

## Core options

The Yabause core has the following option(s) that can be tweaked from the core options menu. The default setting is bolded. 

Settings with (Restart) means that core has to be closed for the new setting to be applied on next launch.

- **Frameskip** [yabause_frameskip] (**disabled**|enabled)

	Frames are skipped when the CPU is unable to keep up a stable rate.
	
- **Force HLE BIOS (restart)** [yabause_force_hle_bios] (**disabled**|enabled)

	HLE BIOS will be used even when a real BIOS file is present.
	
- **Addon Cartridge (restart)** [yabause_addon_cart] (**none**|1M_ram|4M_ram)

	Allows switching between the various RAM cartridges released for the system.
	
	A list of games that require a cartridge can be found [here](https://www.satakore.com/cartridge.php).
	
- **Number of Threads (restart)** [yabause_numthreads] (**1**|2|4|8|16|32)

	Adjust the number of threads to an appropriate level for your CPU.
